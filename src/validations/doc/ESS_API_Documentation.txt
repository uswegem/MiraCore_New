2.6.2 Loan Repayments from Employee 
From time-to-time employees do decide to liquidate their loaned Item before maturity time. In this case employees do pay off the outstanding loan amount after communicating with their respective FSP and being served with a revised final pay off amount. This process has two scenarios where one Employee needs to liquidate the whole loan and the other Employee needs to partially reduce the loan by either paying off some of the principal amount or reducing the repayment time. 
i. Employee login to government platform  
ii. Employee select payment option  
 
B1.  Full payment 
i. 	Employee Enquire loan payoff balance  ii. 	FSP provides loan balance and payment details (reference number) iii. 	Employee make payment using reference number iv. 	FSP acknowledge payment to employee 
v. 	FSP notify the employer about the loan payment vi. 	Employer update loan details 
 
NB. Employee notify FSP and Employer in case of failure

3 DIGITAL SIGNATURE SECURITY  
3.1 Overview 
 	Digital signature will be used for messages exchange between the ESS and 
Financial Service Provider. The FSP will be required to apply for digital signature from Certificate Authority (CA). The exchange of messages will also be done using digital signatures. Prior to being confirmed(verified) using the participant's public key, the message(s) must be signed with the participant's private key. 
3.2 Digital Signature 
 	The security architecture used by the ESS is based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology in which two keys (Public and Private) are used to provide the highest levels of security and universal acceptance. There are typically three algorithms involved with the digital signature process: 
I.Key generation - This algorithm provides a private key along with its   corresponding public key from CA. 
I.Signing - This algorithm produces a signature upon receiving a private key and the message that is being signed. 
I. Verification - This algorithm checks for the authenticity of the message by verifying it along with the signature and the public key. 
3.3 Digital Signature File Format 
 	ESS accepts and shares public key certificate in .cer or .crt format. The expected filename extension fspNameCertificate.cer or fspNameCertificate.crt 
3.4 Signature Algorithm 
The supported signature algorithm is SHA256withRSA with base64 string encoded of character length 344. 
3.5 Signed Final Payload Format 
 	ESS expects message to be digitally signed and obey the following rules: - Sample content to be signed: 
         <Data> 
 	<Header> 
 	 	<Sender>ESS_UTUMISHI</Sender> 
 	 	<Receiver>FSPName</Receiver>
