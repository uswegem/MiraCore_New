### 🔍 **Monitor Deployment:**

1. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/uswegem/MiraCore_New/actions
2. **Server Health**: `http://135.181.33.13:3002/health`
3. **PM2 Status**: `ssh uswege@135.181.33.13 "pm2 list"`
4. **Application Logs**: `ssh uswege@135.181.33.13 "tail -f /home/uswege/ess/logs/app-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log"`

### 🚨 **If Deployment Fails:**

#### **Missing SSH Key Secret:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/uswegem/MiraCore_New/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add secret: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. Value: Your SSH private key content
4. Re-run the workflow

#### **Deployment Issues:**
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Verify server connectivity: `ssh uswege@135.181.33.13`
3. Check PM2 processes: `pm2 list`
4. Review application logs for errors

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
